# NEIGHBORHOOD MAP PROJECT #

## INTRODUCTION ##
- This is my last project, the Neighborhood map which displays the best amusement parks in America.

##HOW TO USE##
- Extract the zip file and open index.html to view the christmas special amusement parks map.
- The whole page is of 3 rows where the top most consists of headings, second one consisting details of the amusement parks with a beautiful image and the third row is the map.
- You can type the name of the amusement park in search box or select the name of the park listed below the search box.
- You can also get into the map directly and select any one of the santa claus markers to find the location of the amusement park.
- By clicking the satellite view u can go deeper to get a top view of the amusement park.

##SOURCES##
- I got a clear view when I pencil sketched the map on how it should be, and then I applied my knowledge from my previous project "BUILD A PORTFOLIO SITE".
- Also in "ONLINE RESUME" project, the map was displayed at the bottom, and so I applied the same by displaying the map in the Last row of the page.
- For Google API key, I went through "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/" which was very helpful in displaying the map.(I used the API key which I used in my online resume project)
- Libraries such as Knockout and jquery were very helpful in different functions such as binding functions.
- The wikipedia API was also helpful in displaying the information regarding the amusement parks displayed in the map.
- StackOverflow site was also helpful in giving a good documentation in Scrolling bar, that was in needed when there are many list of items to be displayed.
- Thanks to Google images for getting high definition image fot the page and Google Fonts for a variety of stylish fonts which I had applied.
- Thanks to my Udacity-stack friends who gave me a clear idea when I was stuck with the overall responsiveness of the page.
- Apart from all online image compressing webites and css minifier sites also had been helpful throughout the project.

##FEATURES OF THE MAP##
- The search bar is diplayed on the left of the page where you can enter the name of the amusement park and check its details in the map.
- The scrollbar is used to check the whole list vertically.
- The place markers are replaced with santa claus icons to get an attractive neighborhood map.
- Whenever a location is clicked, Santa markers bounce on the location displaying the name and the wikipedia link containing the information regarding the amusement park.
- An image potraying joyful people on Christmas eve is been displayed on the right of the search box to get an attractive front page of the neighborhood map.
- The Background image shows the decorations on a christmas eve, that makes the whole page attractive.
